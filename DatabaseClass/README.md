## Database Creation Project

These postgreSQL queries were originally generated by my partner Steve Court
and I as the final project for CS5200, Database Management Systems, at
Northeastern University.

I wrote the queries to create & populate the following tables:
* breedissues
* diagnosticlookup
* breedspecies
* pet
* owner
* medication
* pet_has_owner
* diagnosis
* prescription

I wrote the following applications:
* updaterecords
* breedtreat
* findownerpet
* ordermed
* promptcall
